Material DateTime Picker - Select a time/date in style
======================================================
![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.wdullaer/materialdatetimepicker.svg)


Material DateTime Picker tries to offer you the date and time pickers as shown in [the Material Design spec](http://www.google.com/design/spec/components/pickers.html), with an
easy themable API.
The library uses [the code from the Android frameworks](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/opt/datetimepicker/) as a base and tweaked it to be as close as possible to Material Design example.

Support for Android 4.0 and up.

Feel free to fork or issue pull requests on github. Issues can be reported on the github issue tracker.

Setup
-----
The easiest way to add the Material DateTime Picker library to your project is by adding it as a dependency to your `build.gradle`
```java
dependencies {
  compile 'com.wdullaer:materialdatetimepicker:1.3.1'
}
```

You may also add the library as an Android Library to your project. All the library files live in ```library```.

Using Material Date/Time Pickers
--------------------------------
The library follows the same API as other pickers in the Android framework.
For a basic implementation, you'll need to

1. Implement an `OnTimeSetListener`/`OnDateSetListener`
2. Create a `TimePickerDialog`/`DatePickerDialog` using the supplied factory
3. Theme the pickers

### Implement an `OnTimeSetListener`/`OnDateSetListener`
In order to receive the date or time set in the picker, you will need to implement the `OnTimeSetListener` or
`OnDateSetListener` interfaces. Typically this will be the `Activity` or `Fragment` that creates the Pickers. The callbacks use the same API as the standard Android pickers.
```java
@Override
public void onTimeSet(RadialPickerLayout view, int hourOfDay, int minute) {
  String time = "You picked the following time: "+hourOfDay+"h"+minute;
  timeTextView.setText(time);
}

@Override
public void onDateSet(DatePickerDialog view, int year, int monthOfYear, int dayOfMonth) {
  String date = "You picked the following date: "+dayOfMonth+"/"+(monthOfYear+1)+"/"+year;
  dateTextView.setText(date);
}
```

### Create a `TimePickerDialog`/`DatePickerDialog` using the supplied factory
You will need to create a new instance of `TimePickerDialog` or `DatePickerDialog` using the static `newInstance()` method, supplying proper default values and a callback. Once the dialogs are configured, you can call `show()`.
```java
Calendar now = Calendar.getInstance();
DatePickerDialog dpd = DatePickerDialog.newInstance(
  MainActivity.this,
  now.get(Calendar.YEAR),
  now.get(Calendar.MONTH),
  now.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH)
);
dpd.show(getFragmentManager(), "Datepickerdialog");
```

### Theme the pickers
You can theme the pickers by overwriting the color resources `mdtp_accent_color` and `mdtp_accent_color_dark` in your project.
```xml
<color name="mdtp_accent_color">#009688</color>
<color name="mdtp_accent_color_dark">#00796b</color>
```

Additional Options
------------------
* `TimePickerDialog` dark theme  
The `TimePickerDialog` has a dark theme that can be set by calling
```java
tdp.setThemeDark(true);
```
It doesn't strictly follow the Material Design spec, but gets the job done for the time being

* `OnDismissListener` and `OnCancelListener`  
Both pickers can be passed a `DialogInterface.OnDismissLisener` or `DialogInterface.OnCancelListener` which allows you to run code when either of these events occur.
```java
tpd.setOnCancelListener(new DialogInterface.OnCancelListener() {
    @Override
    public void onCancel(DialogInterface dialogInterface) {
      Log.d("TimePicker", "Dialog was cancelled");
    }
});
```

Potential Improvements
----------------------
* Landscape timepicker can use some improvement
* Code cleanup: there is a bit too much spit and ductape in the tweaks I've done.
